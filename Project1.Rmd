# <u>I.Introduction</u>

> "Immigration is not just a link to America's past; it's also a bridge to America's future. " – George W. Bush

<u>Note:</u> The President spoke about the [Immigration Act of 1990](https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/358) in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. The Act was approved November 29, and was assigned Public Law No. 101 - 649. After that, it made big changes to U.S. immigration laws by allowing more people to immigrate and creating a better-organized system for work-related immigration.

## <u>1. About the H1B Program</u>

[The H1B program](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/immigration/h1b) is a U.S. work visa designed for skilled foreign professionals. It allows companies to hire international workers in specialized fields like IT, engineering, medicine, and finance. Employers must prove that hiring these workers will not negatively impact the U.S. job market.

## <u>2. What is the LCA? </u>

The [Labor Condition Application (LCA)](https://flag.dol.gov/programs/LCA) is a document that employers must file with the [Department of Labor (DOL)](https://flag.dol.gov/) as part of the H1B visa process ***(LCA is a requisite of H1B petition)***. The LCA confirms that the employer will pay the foreign worker fairly and that the hiring won't harm U.S. workers' wages or working conditions. ***Remember:*** When employee obtained LCA (certified status) from DOL, it does not mean that the employee has done the H1B visa's process.

## <u>3. The Process of H1B Visa</u>

The H1B process includes several steps:

1.  The employer files an LCA with the DOL.

2.  After the LCA is approved, the employer registers the worker in the H1B lottery system during the USCIS registration period.

3.  USCIS randomly selects registrants for processing. Only those selected can proceed to the next step.

4.  The employer submits the H1B petition to USCIS and the petition review by USCIS.

5.  The worker applies for the H1B visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate in their home country. If granted, they can begin employment.

<u>You can read more information about [**H1B process (USCIS)**](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-electronic-registration-process).</u>

## 4.<u>Something is very interesting to you?</u>

**H1B Cap-Exempt vs. Regular Employer:**

**1.H1B Cap-Exempt Employer:**

-   These employers are not subject to the annual H1B visa limit [Cap Season](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-cap-season)

-   Typically includes universities, nonprofit research institutions, and government research organizations.

-   Applications can be filed any time of the year without going through the H1B lottery.

**2.H1B Regular Employer:**

-   These employers fall under the annual H1B visa cap.

-   Includes private companies and for-profit organizations.

-   Workers must be selected through the lottery process to proceed with their visa petition if applications exceed the cap.

**For example:**

**H1B Regular Employer in Houston:** Deloitte, Ernst & Young, PWC, KPMG, etc.

**H1B Cap-Exempt Employer in Houston:** MD Anderson, University of Houston System, Houston Independent School District, etc.

# <u>II. About the LCA Dataset</u>

## <u>1. Where is the original data?</u>

The original LCA dataset is publicly available from the U.S. Department of Labor.It is prepared and managed by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) under the Department's Employment and Training Administration. This dataset provides detailed information about H1B applications, including job titles, wages, worksite locations, etc.

***Link to view/download the dataset: [LCA Dataset](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance)***

## <u>2. Why my team chose this dataset?</u>

The dataset we selected focuses on data from 2024 to Q1 of 2025, making it ideal for uncovering key trends in H1B applications during this time period. Our aim is to conduct a detailed analysis to understand:

**1.Application Outcomes:** Examining the trends in certified, denied, and withdrawn applications, and identifying any patterns.

**2. State-Level Insights:** Analyzing how H1B applications are distributed across all U.S. states to determine geographic hotspots for employment-based immigration.

**3.Top Sponsoring Companies:** Highlighting the companies that filed the most applications, providing insights into industries or organizations most reliant on H1B workers.

**4.Quarterly Trends:** Breaking down the data by quarter to observe how application numbers and outcomes fluctuate over time. This approach allows us to spot seasonal trends or shifts in demand.

**5.Wage and Occupation Analysis:** Investigating the offered prevailing wages and job categories (e.g., technology, healthcare) to understand how they align with industry standards and labor market demands.
